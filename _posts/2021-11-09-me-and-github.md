# Welcome

**Hello world**, 

1. Git is a version control system used to manage a version of code. Github is a web-based hosting service for repositories.
2. Git is useful because it tracks all the changes you make while coding and allows you to go back to any old version of your code at any point of time. It also allows for easy collaboration due to its commit message command and and merge command.
3. Github is useful because it allows access for your git-based projects on the internet which overall adds to extreme accessibility.
4. Using both Git and Github allows for a seamless way to change and have access to all the versions of your code both in your terminal and on the web.
